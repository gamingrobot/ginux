======

A research project about scaling networked Linux virtual machines. It uses OpenVZ to create the 10,000 Linux VMs. It has a easy to use web interface for interacting with the 10,000 VMs. The web interface provides a 3D graph representing the network of Linux VMs. It also uses term.js to emulate a xterm interface to the active virtual machine.
